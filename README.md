## Plugin Installation

- Requires Neovim (>= 0.6.0)
- nvim-jdtls is a plugin. Install it like any other Vim plugin:
  - If using [vim-plug][14]: `Plug 'mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls'`
  - If using [packer.nvim][15]: `use 'mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls'`

## Language Server Installation

Install [eclipse.jdt.ls][3] by following their [Installation instructions](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls#installation).

## Configuration

To configure `nvim-jdtls`, add the following in `ftplugin/java.lua` within the
neovim configuration base directory (e.g. `~/.config/nvim/ftplugin/java.lua`,
see `:help base-directory`).

Watch out for the 💀, it indicates that you must adjust something.


```lua
-- See `:help vim.lsp.start_client` for an overview of the supported `config` options.
local config = {
  -- The command that starts the language server
  -- See: https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls#running-from-the-command-line
  cmd = {

    -- 💀
    'java', -- or '/path/to/java11_or_newer/bin/java'
            -- depends on if `java` is in your $PATH env variable and if it points to the right version.

    '-Declipse.application=org.eclipse.jdt.ls.core.id1',
    '-Dosgi.bundles.defaultStartLevel=4',
    '-Declipse.product=org.eclipse.jdt.ls.core.product',
    '-Dlog.protocol=true',
    '-Dlog.level=ALL',

         -- Must point to the                                                     Change this to
         -- eclipse.jdt.ls installation                                           the actual version


    -- 💀
    '-configuration', '/path/to/jdtls_install_location/config_SYSTEM',
                    -- ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^        ^^^^^^
                    -- Must point to the                      Change to one of `linux`, `win` or `mac`
                    -- eclipse.jdt.ls installation            Depending on your system.


    -- 💀
    -- See `data directory configuration` section in the README
    '-data', '/path/to/unique/per/project/workspace/folder'
  },

  -- 💀
  -- This is the default if not provided, you can remove it. Or adjust as needed.
  -- One dedicated LSP server & client will be started per unique root_dir
  root_dir = require('jdtls.setup').find_root({'.git', 'mvnw', 'gradlew'}),

  -- Here you can configure eclipse.jdt.ls specific settings
  -- See https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls/wiki/Running-the-JAVA-LS-server-from-the-command-line#initialize-request
  -- for a list of options
  settings = {
    java = {
    }
  },

  -- Language server `initializationOptions`
  -- You need to extend the `bundles` with paths to jar files
  -- if you want to use additional eclipse.jdt.ls plugins.
  --
  -- See https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls#java-debug-installation
  --
  -- If you don't plan on using the debugger or other eclipse.jdt.ls plugins you can remove this
  init_options = {
    bundles = {}
  },
}
-- This starts a new client & server,
-- or attaches to an existing client & server depending on the `root_dir`.
require('jdtls').start_or_attach(config)
```

The `ftplugin/java.lua` logic is executed each time a `FileType` event
triggers. This happens every time you open a `.java` file or when you invoke
`:set ft=java`:

You can also find more [complete configuration examples in the Wiki][11].

### data directory configuration

`eclipse.jdt.ls` stores project specific data within the folder set via the
`-data` flag. If you're using `eclipse.jdt.ls` with multiple different projects
you must use a dedicated data directory per project.

An example how you could accomplish that is to infer the workspace directory
name from the current working directory:


```lua
-- If you started neovim within `~/dev/xy/project-1` this would resolve to `project-1`
local project_name = vim.fn.fnamemodify(vim.fn.getcwd(), ':p:h:t')

local workspace_dir = '/path/to/workspace-root/' .. project_name
--                                               ^^
--                                               string concattenation in Lua

local config = {
  cmd = {
    ...,

    '-data', workspace_dir,

    ...,
  }
}
```

`...` is not valid Lua in this context. It is meant as placeholder for the
other options from the [Configuration](#configuration) section above.)


### nvim-lspconfig and nvim-jdtls differences

Both nvim-lspconfig and nvim-jdtls use the client built into neovim:

```txt
  ┌────────────┐           ┌────────────────┐
  │ nvim-jdtls │           │ nvim-lspconfig │
  └────────────┘           └────────────────┘
       |                         |
      start_or_attach           nvim_lsp.jdtls.setup
       │                              |
       │                             setup java filetype hook
       │    ┌─────────┐                  │
       └───►│ vim.lsp │◄─────────────────┘
            └─────────┘
                .start_client
                .buf_attach_client
```

Some differences between the two:

- The `setup` of lspconfig creates a `java` filetype hook itself and provides
  some defaults for the `cmd` of the `config`.
- `nvim-jdtls` delegates the choice when to call `start_or_attach` to the user.
- `nvim-jdtls` adds some logic to handle `jdt://` URIs. These are necessary to
  load source code from third party libraries or the JDK.
- `nvim-jdtls` adds some additional handlers and sets same extra capabilities
  to enable all the extensions.

You could use either to start the `eclipse.jdt.ls` client, but it is
recommended to use the `start_or_attach` method from `nvim-jdtls` because of
the additional capabilities it configures and because of the `jdt://` URI
handling.

You **must not** use both at the same time for java. You'd end up with two
clients and two language server instances.


### UI picker customization

**Tip**: You can get a better UI for code-actions and other functions by
overriding the `jdtls.ui` picker. See [UI Extensions][10].


## Usage

`nvim-jdtls` extends the capabilities of the built-in LSP support in
Neovim, so all the functions mentioned in `:help lsp` will work.

`nvim-jdtls` provides some extras, for those you'll want to create additional
mappings:

```vimL
nnoremap <A-o> <Cmd>lua require'jdtls'.organize_imports()<CR>
nnoremap crv <Cmd>lua require('jdtls').extract_variable()<CR>
vnoremap crv <Esc><Cmd>lua require('jdtls').extract_variable(true)<CR>
nnoremap crc <Cmd>lua require('jdtls').extract_constant()<CR>
vnoremap crc <Esc><Cmd>lua require('jdtls').extract_constant(true)<CR>
vnoremap crm <Esc><Cmd>lua require('jdtls').extract_method(true)<CR>


-- If using nvim-dap
-- This requires java-debug and vscode-java-test bundles, see install steps in this README further below.
nnoremap <leader>df <Cmd>lua require'jdtls'.test_class()<CR>
nnoremap <leader>dn <Cmd>lua require'jdtls'.test_nearest_method()<CR>
```


Some methods are better exposed via commands. As a shortcut you can also call
`:lua require('jdtls.setup').add_commands()` to declare these.

It's recommended to call `add_commands` within the `on_attach` handler that can be set on the `config` table which is passed to `start_or_attach`.
If you use jdtls together with nvim-dap, call `add_commands` *after* `setup_dap` to ensure it includes debugging related commands. (More about this is in the debugger setup section further below)


```vimL
command! -buffer JdtCompile lua require('jdtls').compile()
command! -buffer JdtUpdateConfig lua require('jdtls').update_project_config()
command! -buffer JdtJol lua require('jdtls').jol()
command! -buffer JdtBytecode lua require('jdtls').javap()
command! -buffer JdtJshell lua require('jdtls').jshell()
```


## Debugger (via nvim-dap)


`nvim-jdtls` provides integration with [nvim-dap][5].

Once setup correctly, it enables the following additional functionality:

1. Debug applications via explicit configurations
2. Debug automatically discovered main classes
3. Debug junit tests. Either whole classes or individual test methods

For 1 & 2 to work, [eclipse.jdt.ls][3] needs to load the [java-debug][6]
extension. For 3 to work, it also needs to load the [vscode-java-test][7] extension.

For usage instructions once installed, read the [nvim-dap][5] help.
Debugging junit test classes or methods will be possible via these two functions:

```lua
require'jdtls'.test_class()
require'jdtls'.test_nearest_method()
```

### java-debug installation

- Clone [java-debug][6]
- Navigate into the cloned repository (`cd java-debug`)
- Run `./mvnw clean install`
- Set or extend the `initializationOptions` (= `init_options` of the `config` from [configuration](#Configuration)) as follows:


```lua
config['init_options'] = {
  bundles = {
    vim.fn.glob("path/to/java-debug/com.microsoft.java.debug.plugin/target/com.microsoft.java.debug.plugin-*.jar")
  };
}
```

### nvim-dap setup

You also need to call `require('jdtls').setup_dap()` to have it register a
`java` adapter.

To do that, extend the [configuration](#Configuration):

```lua
config['on_attach'] = function(client, bufnr)
  -- With `hotcodereplace = 'auto' the debug adapter will try to apply code changes
  -- you make during a debug session immediately.
  -- Remove the option if you do not want that.
  require('jdtls').setup_dap({ hotcodereplace = 'auto' })
end
```

If you also want to discover main classes and create configuration entries for them, you have to call `require('jdtls.dap').setup_dap_main_class_configs()` or use the `JdtRefreshDebugConfigs` command which is added as part of `add_commands()` which is mentioned in the [Usage](#Usage) section.

Note that eclipse.jdt.ls needs to have loaded your project before it can discover all main classes and that may take some time. It is best to trigger this deferred or ad-hoc when first required.


See the [nvim-dap Adapter Installation Wiki](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/wiki/Debug-Adapter-installation#Java)
for example configurations in case you're not going to use the main-class discovery functionality of nvim-jdtls.

### vscode-java-test installation

To be able to debug junit tests, it is necessary to install the bundles from [vscode-java-test][7]:

- Clone the repository
- Navigate into the folder (`cd vscode-java-test`)
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run build-plugin`
- Extend the bundles in the nvim-jdtls config:


```lua

-- This bundles definition is the same as in the previous section (java-debug installation)
local bundles = {
  vim.fn.glob("path/to/java-debug/com.microsoft.java.debug.plugin/target/com.microsoft.java.debug.plugin-*.jar"),
};

-- This is the new part
vim.list_extend(bundles, vim.split(vim.fn.glob("/path/to/microsoft/vscode-java-test/server/*.jar"), "\n"))
config['init_options'] = {
  bundles = bundles;
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### vim.lsp.buf functions don't do anything

This can have two reasons:

1. The client and server aren't starting up correctly.

You can check if the client is running with `:lua print(vim.inspect(vim.lsp.buf_get_clients()))`, it should output a lot of information.
If it doesn't, verify:

- That the language server can be started standalone. (Run eclipse.jdt.ls)
- That there are no configuration errors. (Run `:set ft=java` and `:messages` after opening a Java file)
- Check the log files (`:lua print(vim.fn.stdpath('cache'))` lists the path, there should be a `lsp.log`)


2. Eclipse.jdt.ls can't compile your project or it cannot load your project and resolve the class paths.

- Run `:JdtCompile` for incremental compilation or `:JdtCompile full` for full
  compilation. If there are any errors in the project, it will open the
  quickfix list with the errors.

- Check the log files (`:lua print(vim.fn.stdpath('cache'))` lists the path, there should be a `lsp.log`)
- If there is nothing, try changing the log level. See `:help vim.lsp.set_log_level()`


### Diagnostics and completion suggestions are slow

Completion requests can be quite expensive on big projects. If you're using
some kind of auto-completion plugin that triggers completion requests
automatically, consider deactivating it or tuning it so it is less aggressive.
Triggering a completion request on each typed character is likely overloading
[eclipse.jdt.ls][3].


### Newly added dependencies are not found

You can try running `:JdtUpdateConfig` to refresh the configuration. If that
doesn't work you'll need to restart the language server.

### Language server doesn't find classes that should be there

The language server has its own mental model of which files exists based on
what the client tells it. If you modify files outside of neovim, then the
language server won't be notified of the changes. This can happen for example
if you switch to a different branch with git.

If the language server doesn't get a notification about a new file, you might
get errors, telling you that a class cannot be resolved. If that is the case,
open the file and save it. Then the language server will be notified about the
new file and it should start to recognize the classes within the file.


### After updating eclipse.jdt.ls it doesn't work properly anymore

Try wiping your workspace folder and restart Neovim and the language server.

(the workspace folder is the path you used as argument to `-data` in `config.cmd`)
